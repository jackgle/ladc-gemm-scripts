Matlab scripts for processing and analysis of acoustic data. Tools for pattern recognition and waveform classification are included. These were written for Environmental Acoustic Recording System (EARS) data.

Long-term passive acoustic monitoring has been implemented to support population models of marine mammals in the Gulf of Mexico. Techniques for mining large volumes of acoustic data are in development. 

## Examples

(1)
Load detect_test.mat from the 'test' directory into MATLAB. Run the 'run_patterndetect.m' script. Follow instructions from the command line. The extracted frames now held in the structure array can be viewed with view_struct.m 

(2)
Load class_test.mat from the 'test' directory. Run 'run_clustering.m'.

## Dependencies

MATLAB (Toolboxes: Neural Network, Signal Processing, Statistics and Machine Learning, Wavelet)

Note: Only a few specific functions require the neural network, and wavelet toolboxes.
